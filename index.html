        <h1>Spelling Homophones and Other Training (SHOT)</h1>
        <p>Spelling Homophones and Other Training (SHOT) is a computer program designed to assist
            English language learners with homophones. English is a
            <a href="https://www.oxford-royale.com/articles/learning-english-hard">notoriously difficult</a>
            language to learn, and homophones, homographs, and homonyms can be “very difficult to
            identify and to understand [for] learners of English as the second language”
            (<a href="https://papers.iafor.org/wp-content/uploads/papers/acll2013/ACLL2013_0140.pdf">page 275</a>).
            The main focus of SHOT is homophones since they are easier to spot and check
            (it is much easier to check spelling than pronunciation or meaning). However, functionality
            for the other two could be implemented in the future.</p>
        <p>SHOT is a highly customizable program. It allows learners to select only the words
            they want to work with and includes filters to sort through the list of words more
            easily. Additionally, the list of words contains examples and definitions that
            learners could use to study (currently, these are tooltips seen by hovering the
            mouse over the word in the list). Furthermore, the save and load feature allows
            people to share customized lessons or return to the same lesson later. Teachers
            could use saving and loading to give each student the same lesson relevant to the
            current course material. In the future, this could be expanded to include custom
            words so that lesson plans can be even more personalized and focused on what is
            important to the teacher or individual learners. Additionally, SHOT includes an
            optional self-test to check and rate learners’ understanding of homophones. This
            test allows SHOT to individualize a lesson plan focusing on homophones that present
            difficulty to a specific learner.</p>
        <p>SHOT also has methods for learning as a group as well as individually. For example,
            a group of learners could select the same lesson plan and compete against each other
            for the highest score. In the future, a leaderboard could be implemented to compare
            scores against other learners. Alternatively, individual learners could use the same
            lesson plan and compete against themselves for the quickest time or highest score.
            Learners can limit a lesson by time or the number of questions asked. When the lesson
            is complete, learners will see statistics on their performance, including performance
            for specific words and overall performance. Additionally, there is an option to hide
            the timer, as it may be stressful for some learners to see time ticking away; time
            will still be tracked for the performance statistics.</p>
        <p>In the future, SHOT could be expanded to include homonyms and homographs. This expansion
            could mean including speech recognition for homograph training, as it would allow for
            more types of problems. For example, a sentence could be displayed to the learner for
            them to speak. Alternatively, there could be a matching task where learners are played
            the sound of the word which they then match to the correct meaning. On the other hand,
            homonym training may be limited since there are few ways to check if learners understand
            the meaning of two words that are spelled and pronounced the same. One way to check
            understanding of homographs could be to have a matching task where one side is a sentence
            and the other is the word’s definition.</p>

        <p><b>DISCLAIMER</b>: SHOT in its current state does not contain many of the features presented above.
        This is simply a description of the intention behind the program.</p>
